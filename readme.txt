Vale

This Vale configuration file points to the .vale-styles directory as the location for all Vale-related files. You can use the Vale configuration file generator to generate a configuration file that includes some predefined style packages. For more information, see Vale config file.

With the .vale.ini file open, Grazie Professional suggests initializing the configuration file by running vale sync. Once you have the correct styles defined in .vale-style, Grazie Professional highlights any problems that it finds in supported files.
